<p>Directus is an Open Data Platform purpose-built for democratizing the world's data. By staying small and agile, we remain completely focused on the product itself, avoiding the financial trap that often comes with taking on capital too early and concentrating solely on sales and rapid expansion. We believe in stable, informed growth, with every decision based on real-world usage and research.</p>
<h2>A team of passionate creators</h2>
<p>We are a team of developers, designers, innovators, and entrepreneurs, all laser-focused on building something truly amazing.</p>
<h2>An all-remote team</h2>
<p>Our team is 100% remote, with flexible working hours, asynchronous communication, and the freedom to work from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection.</p>
<h2>International by design</h2>
<p>To build a global platform, you need a global team. It's no accident that our talented, diverse, and multilingual team is distributed around the entire world.</p>
<h2>Contributor-first hiring</h2>
<p>Many of our hires start off as contributors, so they are already familiar with our codebase, understand the pull request flow, and are engaged in open-source.</p>
